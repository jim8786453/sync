Designed to simplify the process of keeping data sychronised between multiple clients. It provides an API to perform create, update or delete operations that will be synchronised to other clients, as well as keep up-to-date with changes they make.

For example, a poor but commonly used method of synchronising records of data between two systems is to read and write CSV files to an FTP site. This can be error prone and scales badly when more systems also need to synchronise the same data. Sync can be used to help manage this situatation and reduce the number of point-to-point connections that have to be maintained.

The [documentation](http://py-sync.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?) is currently built and hosted on Read The Docs.
